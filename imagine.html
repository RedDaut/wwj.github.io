"Previously you may have had a logical excuse for not having forced Life to come through with whatever you asked, but that alibi is now obsolete, because you are in possession of the Master Key that unlocks the door to Life’s bountiful riches. The Master Key is intangible, but it is powerful! It is the privilege of creating, in your own mind, a BURNING DESIRE for a definite form of riches. There is no penalty for the use of the Key, but there is a price you must pay if you do not use it. The price is FAILURE. There is a reward of stupendous proportions if you put the Key to use. It is the satisfaction that comes to all who conquer self and force Life to pay whatever is asked."

"Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his ships and cut all sources of retreat. Only by so doing can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a BURNING DESIRE TO WIN, essential to success."

The above two passages are from Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. It's required reading in my humble opinion.

Many people aren't willing to take the time to read, study, and understand what actually works (such as the previously mentioned Think and Grow Rich) instead they opt to rely on things such as sheer force of willpower which does not work and then are surprised or defeated by the undesirable results.

In his book Eating for Life, Bill Phillips had this to say about the shortcomings of will:

"...high level of awareness and urgency is feeding the desire to change. That's empowering "will." That's definitely good. However, it's not enough. Let me explain... I disagree with the popular saying, "Where there's a will, there's a way." Here's why: Having had the opportunity to work with thousands of people who desperately wanted to change, who had plenty of will, I witnessed something interesting, firsthand. What I saw was without knowing the right way, people with a powerful will were fired up, but yet very frustrated. That's because, despite their best efforts, they couldn't create a positive change, they couldn't manifest the turning point that they craved. Think of the frantic lab rat trying to escape a maze. Lots of effort, only to hit head on, one dead end after another. Eventually, exhausted."

So what gives? These well intended people were on the right track but were lacking the most important thing. Keep reading to find out what. 

Sure, a strong and steady will is necessary, in fact you have to have an incredible ability to focus, but what is proper use of the will? Proper use of the will is holding an image in your mind. You don't force yourself to do anything, unless you see yourself going through it due to current conditioning. Proper use of the will is holding an image in your mind. That's it! 

In other words "We act, or fail to act, not because of "will," as is so commonly believed, but because of imagination." That was said by Maxwell Maltz in his Book Psycho-Cybernetics. Study and understand this book thoroughly!

Genevieve Behrend in her book Your Invisible Power (published in 1921) ties it all together quite nicely "When your understanding grasps the power to visualize your heart's desire and hold it with your will, it attracts to you all things requisite to the fulfillment of that picture by the harmonious vibrations of the law of attraction. You realize that since Order is Heaven's first law, and visualization places things in their natural element, then it must be a heavenly thing to visualize."

So visualizing your heart's desire, which means holding an image in your imagination, with the proper use of will leads to the fulfillment of your desire. This puts you squarely on the pathway to being successful.

But wait! There's more to it.

And this is really important so pay close attention.

You must have a healthy self-image. Meaning you must believe in yourself. And because of this belief you are willing to test, experiment, and try new things even when you feel uncertain. If you don’t believe that it’s possible to make new things work, then it’s hard to make any progress. Doesn't matter how good the ideas are, the images you hold in your imagination, visualization, nothing will work for you if you don’t believe in it. And more importantly, nothing will work if you don’t believe in yourself.

I believe in myself. This confidence has made the difference for me again and again. I didn’t need intelligence or opportunity or resources. Just a simple belief in myself.

You have to be willing to get lost and take wrong turns. You have to be willing to start the journey, even when you’re not sure what lies ahead. Be courageous, and lean into uncertainty. Embrace ready enough. Start down a path even though you can’t see more than two steps in front of you. Have faith.

When we say "I'm not ready." there's an undercurrent of self-doubt and vulnerability. Your conditioning, your paradigm, your self-image aren't in harmony with believing in yourself, “I don’t believe these ideas will work for me.” Or, put another way, “I don’t believe I can make these ideas work. I don’t believe in myself.”

Why are you determined to make these ideas not work for you? Why are you searching for reasons why these ideas won’t succeed instead of figuring out a way to make something good happen?

The biggest difference I’ve noticed between successful people and unsuccessful people isn’t intelligence or opportunity or resources. It’s the belief that they can make their goals happen. More importantly, their belief in themselves.

Napoleon Hill in his book Think and Grow Rich writes "There is a difference between WISHING for a thing and being READY to receive it. No one is ready for a thing, until he believes he can acquire it. The state of mind must be BELIEF, not mere hope or wish. Open-mindedness is essential for belief. Closed minds do not inspire faith, courage, and belief."

"Remember, no more effort is required to aim high in life, to demand abundance and prosperity, than is required to accept misery and poverty."

So many of us confuse being “ready” with being 100% ready, no doubt, no fear, no unknown. We think being "ready" means having a solid plan mapped out, with every twist and turn accounted for, with three detours and back up plans ready to go. We confuse being “ready” with being completely confident and boldly assured in our plan for change. We think "ready" means sure and certain.

And I’m here to be the bubble buster that tells you that kind of "ready" doesn’t exist.

Don’t get me wrong; being prepared and confident is important. Having a plan in place and exploring various options is vital. Critically thinking through consequences and “what ifs” is awesome. But those things are not the same as being 100% ready with no fear or doubt present. Somewhere along the way, we’ve confused the two. And it’s left us feeling paralyzed when it comes to change.

Forget "ready." Embrace "ready enough." 

"Ready enough" values thought and preparation, but acknowledges lingering uncertainty. "Ready enough" calls for belief in your voice and vision, while also knowing that self-doubt will chime in. "Ready enough" has a plan, but knows a little bit of winging it is necessary. Fear and doubt are normal when making important decisions. It’s healthy to wonder, "Can I do this?" It’s human to want to perfect conditions for change, eliminating any change of failure or struggle. Yet, this kind of perfect and total readiness isn’t realistic.

I will admit that out of all the barriers to change, this might be my kryptonite. Fear can do wonders when I’m looking to make a change, and changing the question from "Am I ready?" to "Am I ready enough?" has made a major difference. But the biggest difference is when I no longer pose a question. Instead I make the statement "I AM ready (enough)" Suddenly, fear and doubt aren’t giant detour signs, and my plans for change aren’t derailed. Ready enough reminds me to think through things, evaluate my options, and then if things are still in play, proceed bravely all while holding and maintaining the image in my imagination, thinking from the end result. 

It’s time to get unstuck. Be thoughtful about the change you want to make. Be prepared. Have a plan in place, and be aware of potential obstacles. But don’t confuse that with being ready and certain. Don’t think that because there isn’t a clear path, you’re supposed to hang back and wait. Stop waiting for these things. They’re stunting your growth and suffocating your dreams.
